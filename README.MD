# Coffee Bean App
*A Coffee Bean App written in Kotlin, Python, HTML and CSS.*
# Summary
Back to the second last semester in college, I learned a TON about problem-solving and new knowledge from this project. By learning cloud integration (AWS), web/REST (Representational State Transfer) services and flask framework to create secure Android and web apps. Both web end and Android end invoke the data from Flask back end which get the data from NoSQL database (MongoDB).   

Both flask and Kotlin were new for me, it took me almost one month to get familiar with the whole structure. After I got used to it, I started to love this elegant design concept.
